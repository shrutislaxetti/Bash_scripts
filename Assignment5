Write a script that runs three commands:

Evaluate an arithmetic expression
Attempt to remove a file that does not exist in the current directory
Evaluate another arithmetic expression

Immediately after each command, echo the exit status of that command to the terminal using the 
appropriate variable to show success and failure exit codes.

#arithmetic expression
declare -i p="4+5"
echo $p
9

#remove a file 
read file
if [[ ! -f /home/ec2-user/$file ]] OR if [[ ! -e /home/ec2-user/$file]]
then
  echo "file not found"
  echo "rm $file"
else
   echo "exists"
fi

#arithmetic expression
let n=15/2
$ echo $n
7
