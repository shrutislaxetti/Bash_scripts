Write a script that assigns a variable that contains a list of all shell scripts (*.sh) in the 
current directory (command redirection). Using the 'for'statement from the course, iterate through that 
list of files and display the filename of each and cat out the contents to the terminal.


declare -a arrPics
count=$((ls *.sh) | wc -w)
echo $count
#for (( i=1; i<=$count; i++ ))
#do
#  echo $file
#   sh $file
#done

for file in *.sh
do
    arrPics=("${arrPics[@]}" "$file")
    arrPics=("$file")

    echo $arrPics
    sh $arrPics
 
done
