Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. 
Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display 
the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null 
(to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

!#/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3"
read REPLY
if [ "$REPLY" -ge 1 ] && [ "$REPLY" -le 3 ]; then
 echo "the number entred is $REPLY"
else
 echo "You have entered a wrong number & failed to follow instructions" >> /dev/null
fi
