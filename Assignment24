We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented 
languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each 
gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics
of the indicated gender.

#!/bin/bash
read -p "gender:" gender\

my_function(){
   local arms=2
   legs=4
   echo " arms:$arms, legs=$legs
   if ($gender=="male"); then
   my_function1
   else
   my_function2
   fi
}
my_function1(){
echo "has beards"
}
my_function2(){
echo "no beards
}
my_function
