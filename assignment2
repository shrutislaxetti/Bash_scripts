Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to 
the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

#!/bin/bash
STARTOFSCRIPT=$SECONDS
sleep 5
MYUSERNAME="s32"
MYPASSWORD="123"
echo "MYUSERNAME is ${MYUSERNAME} & MYPASSWORD is ${MYPASSWORD}"
ENDOFSCRIPT=$SECONDS
ELAPSED_TIME=$(($ENDOFSCRIPT - $STARTOFSCRIPT))
#ELAPSED_TIME="$(($(SECONDS)-${START_TIME}))"
echo $ELAPSED_TIME
