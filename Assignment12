Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. 
Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course,
test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). 
If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

!#/bin/bash

echo "guess a secret number between 1 and 5"
read guess
secret=$guess
if [ "$secret" -ge 1 ] && [ "$secret" -le 5 ]; then
 echo "successlly guessed the right number"
fi
