Create a simple text file containing a list of super heros (or some names if preferred), 
use at least four values,one per line in the file.
Write a bash shell script that then reads that file and displays it line by line on the terminal window.

input="/home/ec2-user/demo.sh"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "$line"
done < "$input"

#gedit demo.sh #edit the file
echo "$(date)>> demo.sh
