Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file. 

For example, a text file may look like this:

	The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was unaffected by these events.



The program would find these occurrences and prompt the user to replace them.

Enter an adjective:
silly
Enter a noun:
chandelier
Enter a verb:
screamed
Enter a noun:
pickup truck

#!/bin/bash/python
string ="The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was unaffected by these events."
adjective=input("Enter an adjective: ")
string=string.replace("ADJECTIVE",adjective)
noun=input("Enter an noun: ")
string=string.replace("NOUN",noun)
verb=input("Enter an verb: ")
string=string.replace("VERB",verb)
print(string)
