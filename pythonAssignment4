Strong Password Detection
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and 
lowercase characters, and has at least one digit. 
You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.

import re 
passw = input("Enter Password :")
fl = 0
while True:   
   if (len(passw)<8): 
      fl= -1
      break
   elif not re.search("[a-z]", passw ): 
      fl = -1
      break
   elif not re.search("[A-Z]", passw): 
        fl = -1
        break
   elif not any(char.isdigit() for char in passw):
      fl = -1
      break
   elif not re.search("[_@$]", passw): 
      fl = -1
      break
   else: 
      fl = 0
      print(" This Is Valid Password") 
      break
if fl ==-1: 
   print("Not a Valid Password")
