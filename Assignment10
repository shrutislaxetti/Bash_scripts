Create a script that, when run, will accept two command line values as arguments. 
These arguments should be a username and password and assigned to two variables in the script named appropriately. Finally,
echo those values out to the terminal when run to indicate they were read and assigned as expected.
 
read -p "username:" user_var1  
echo "The username is: " $user_var1 
read -p "password:" user_var2
echo "The password is: " $user_var2
