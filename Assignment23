Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. 
Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that 
command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message
to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age,add a calculation of their age in number of days.


#!/bin/bash

read -p "Userfname:" fname
read -p "Age:" age

my_function () {
  local var1=$fname
  var2=$age
  echo "Inside function: Userfname: $fname, Age: $age"
}

echo "Before executing function: Userfname: $fname, Age: $age"

my_function
